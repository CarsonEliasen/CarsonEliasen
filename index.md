## About Me <img src = "https://github.com/CarsonEliasen/CarsonEliasen/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/headshot_RDC.jpg?raw=true" width = "250" height  = "250" align = "right" style = "margin: 25px 25px 25px 25px">
My name is Carson Eliasen and I am a hobby game developer and design thinking educator from Fort Collins, CO. My first game Fiefdom is out for early access now on Steam!

I am finishing up my undergrad in psychology with a minor in applied data science. I've worked for 3 years in design thinking education and am looking to explore designing for human-computer interaction. Eventually, I'd love to get my graduate degree in computer graphics processing while also bolstering my design thinking background. Generally I'm a dynamic problem solver that loves to dip my cup into as many disciplines as I can, and then integrate them all together.

## Fiefdom

### Summary
Fiefdom is my early access medieval city management game. Keeping your subjects content becomes a lot more difficult when you have to keep the ambitions of your court in check. Players must manage an ever changing supply of resources like food, money, stability, and more.

#### Check out the Steam page for more information [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1994110/Fiefdom/).

### Design Philosophy
While developing Fiefdom, I want to really focus on the player experience. Of course I have a million and half ideas about how I would develop Fiefdom, but a wide and diverse player base will be able to tell me what is actually enjoyable for the average player. Overall, I aim to bring my human-centered design experience to the forfront when working on Fiefdom. This means doing several rounds of alpha testing and getting early access out as soon as possible.

### Future Updates
- ***Wildlife Update***: This will aim to make the area surrounding your fief feel more alive and also make you feel like you can have a more direct impact on the local fauna. Included with this update will also be a weather revamp to make seasons feel more unique. We are already developing this and should be released by the start of Q4 2022!
- ***Military Update***: This will most likely be the largest of any of the major updates. It will focus on a warring system where you can both invade and get invaded by adjacent kingdoms. Combat simulations and conquering systems will allow you to grow your kingdom at a rapid pace or drive it into the ground. Depending on the depth of the update and the demands of life (we still have real jobs for now), we’re hoping to have this out some time in 2023.
- ***Adventure Update***: This update will focus on expanding the family tree system that’s already in place by allowing family members to go on adventures to earn glory or disgrace themselves trying. Minigames may also be incorporated within this system to allow for more engaging gameplay during downtime. No estimates for release date yet.
- ***Magic Update***: This will add a magic system that is intertwined with other aspects of the game, adding more depth and customizability. No estimates for release date yet.
- ***Other Areas of Improvement***: Control settings, accessibility settings, improving efficiency, saving and loading fiefs, resource/population graphs over time, steam achievements, family tree portraits, and more!

## Harmony

Harmony is a two player board game I developed in the summer of 2019. It has been described by players as a mix between chess and connect 4. While designing this game, I utilized a rapid prototyping approach to test and refine it to where it is today. In the game, players try and make a pattern using both their pieces and their opponent's pieces on the board consisting of concentric circles. On their turn, a player can make 2 moves consisting of their pieces or 1 move consisting of their opponent's pieces. A full rulebook can be found [here](https://github.com/CarsonEliasen/CarsonEliasen/blob/gh-pages/assets/documents/How%20to%20Play%20Harmony.pdf).

## Design Thinking Experience

### Background 
I've been in design thinking education for three years, where I started as a teaching assisstant. As I grew in the program, I was able to start developing my own tools and refining them through student feedback. Right now, I'm working on developing k12 workshops for students attending schools in the area to start experiencing design thinking early in their acedemic career.

### The Pivot Grid 

I developed the pivot grid for my introduction to design thinking class to help them make unbiased decisions about pivoting their problems. The first step is to collect data about if people are actually experiencing an identified problem. A key aspect of this data that needs to be gathered is how passionate/engaged people are with the issue being discussed. Once the data is collected, it can be condensed into data themes. The themes *then* get placed onto the grid, which axes are labeled interviewee engagement and relevance to identified problem. Depending on where the majority of themes lie on the grid, the teams can then make an informed decision on pivoting or reframing their problem.

### The Why Tree

"The Why Tree" is a tool I am currently developing as a simplified version of the fishbone diagram discussed [here](https://asq.org/quality-resources/fishbone). To use the why tree, users write their assumed problem down at the top of a piece of paper. Then, they think of two potential causes for that problem. For each of those two causes, users then think of two reasons for *why* that is an issue. The top level, what was thought to be the original problem, is labeled as a symptom of the actual problem, which is the level below. The for reasons below that level are the user's motivators, and are often good places to start ideating for stakeholders and/or archetypes.
