## About Me <a name = "about"></a><img src = "https://github.com/CarsonEliasen/CarsonEliasen/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/headshot_RDC.jpg?raw=true" width = "250" height  = "250" align = "right" style = "margin: 25px 25px 25px 25px">
My name is Carson Eliasen and I am a hobby game developer and design thinking educator from Longmont, CO.

I am finishing up my undergrad in psychology with a minor in applied data science at Colorado State University (CSU). I've worked for 3 years in design thinking education and am looking to explore designing for human-computer interaction. Eventually, I'd love to get my graduate degree in computer graphics processing while also bolstering my design thinking background. Generally I'm a dynamic problem solver that loves to dip my cup into as many disciplines as I can, and then integrate them all together.

In my free time I love listening to music on high fidelity set ups, drinking fancy teas, painting, and playing video and board games. I'm always looking to make a new friend and love to hang out at coffee shops with anyone and everyone.

## Architect <a name = "architect"></a>
Architect is the working title for a project I'm aiming to release by the end of 2022. Inspired by the likes of M.C. Escher, Oskar Reutersvard, and Monument Valley, the goal is to produce a powerful tool for people to make impossible geometry. Although I hope it to be as engaging as a video game, I like to think of it more like a collaborative art piece. With the same basic rules, people will able to make intruiging and distinct art pieces to share with the world.

## Harmony <a name = "harmony"></a>

Harmony is a two player board game I developed in the summer of 2019. While designing this game, I utilized a rapid prototyping approach to test and refine it to where it is today. In the game, players try and make a pattern using both their pieces and their opponent's pieces on the board consisting of concentric circles. On their turn, a player can make 2 moves consisting of their pieces or 1 move consisting of their opponent's pieces. A full rulebook can be found [here](https://github.com/CarsonEliasen/CarsonEliasen/blob/gh-pages/assets/documents/How%20to%20Play%20Harmony.pdf).

Feedback from players has been extremely positive. People has been describe it as a mix between chess and connect 4 and they love that it is easy to learn, yet hard to master. I hope to release a digital version and perhaps even get it onto store shelves one day.

## Fiefdom <a name = "fiefdom"></a>

Fiefdom is my early access medieval city management game. Keeping your subjects content becomes a lot more difficult when you have to keep the ambitions of your court in check. Players must manage an ever changing supply of resources like food, money, stability, and more.

## Design Thinking Experience <a name = "DT"></a>

### Background 
I've been in design thinking education for three years, where I started as a teaching assisstant. As I grew in the program, I was able to start developing my own tools and refining them through student feedback. Right now, I'm working on developing k12 workshops for students attending schools in the area to start experiencing design thinking early in their acedemic career.

### The Pivot Grid 

I developed the pivot grid for my introduction to design thinking class to help them make unbiased decisions about pivoting their problems. The first step is to collect data about if people are actually experiencing an identified problem. A key aspect of this data that needs to be gathered is how passionate/engaged people are with the issue being discussed. Once the data is collected, it can be condensed into data themes. The themes *then* get placed onto the grid, which axes are labeled interviewee engagement and relevance to identified problem. Depending on where the majority of themes lie on the grid, the teams can then make an informed decision on pivoting or reframing their problem.

### The Why Tree

"The Why Tree" is a tool I am currently developing as a simplified version of the fishbone diagram discussed [here](https://asq.org/quality-resources/fishbone). To use the why tree, users write their assumed problem down at the top of a piece of paper. Then, they think of two potential causes for that problem. For each of those two causes, users then think of two reasons for *why* that is an issue. The top level, what was thought to be the original problem, is labeled as a symptom of the actual problem, which is the level below. The for reasons below that level are the user's motivators, and are often good places to start ideating for stakeholders and/or archetypes.
